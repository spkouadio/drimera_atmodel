The Drift Modeling for Environment Assessment (DRIMERA) is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for
aerial applied pesticides concentration simulation

### Features :

- Euler model by FDM solver coupled with Weibull Law and Wind Rose for pesticide droplets flow in air.

- Environmental risk assessment that can occur from aerial spraying.

- Firstly designed for Banana black leaf streak disease BLSD aerial treatment risk assessment.
