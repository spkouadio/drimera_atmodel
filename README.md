The Drift Modeling for Environment Assessment (DRIMERA) is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for
aerial applied pesticides concentration simulation

### Features :

- Euler-Lagrange granular flow model by FDM solver for air and pesticide droplets.

- Environmental risk assessment that can occur from aerial spraying.

- Firstly designed for Banana black leaf streak disease BLSD aerial treatment risk assessment.
